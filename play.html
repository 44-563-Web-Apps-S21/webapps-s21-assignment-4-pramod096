        SCENE I. Padua. BAPTISTA'S house.
        Enter LUCENTIO, HORTENSIO, and BIANCA
        LUCENTIO
        Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir:
        Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
        Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?
        HORTENSIO   
        But, wrangling pedant, this is
        The patroness of heavenly harmony:
        Then give me leave to have prerogative;
        And when in music we have spent an hour,
        Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.
        LUCENTIO
        Preposterous ass, that never read so far
        To know the cause why music was ordain'd!
        Was it not to refresh the mind of man
        After his studies or his usual pain?
        Then give me leave to read philosophy,
        And while I pause, serve in your harmony.
        HORTENSIO
        Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.
        BIANCA
        Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,
        To strive for that which resteth in my choice:
        I am no breeching scholar in the schools;
        I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
        But learn my lessons as I please myself.
        And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:
        Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;
        His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.
        HORTENSIO
        You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
        LUCENTIO
        That will be never: tune your instrument.
        BIANCA
        Where left we last?
        LUCENTIO
        Here, madam:
        'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;
        Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'
        BIANCA
        Construe them.

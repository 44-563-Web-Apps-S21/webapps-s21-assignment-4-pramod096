        <p>Enter LUCENTIO, HORTENSIO, and BIANCA</p>

        <h6>LUCENTIO</h6>
        <p>Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir:
        Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
        Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?</p>

        <h6>HORTENSIO</h6>  
        <p>But, wrangling pedant, this is
        The patroness of heavenly harmony:
        Then give me leave to have prerogative;
        And when in music we have spent an hour,
        Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.</p>

        <h6>LUCENTIO</h6>
        <p>Preposterous ass, that never read so far
        To know the cause why music was ordain'd!
        Was it not to refresh the mind of man
        After his studies or his usual pain?
        Then give me leave to read philosophy,
        And while I pause, serve in your harmony.</p>

        <h6>HORTENSIO</h6>
        <p>Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.</p>

        <h6>BIANCA</h6>
        <p>Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,
        To strive for that which resteth in my choice:
        I am no breeching scholar in the schools;
        I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
        But learn my lessons as I please myself.
        And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:
        Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;
        His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.</p>

        <h6>HORTENSIO</h6>
        <p>You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?</p>

        <h6>LUCENTIO</h6>
        <p>That will be never: tune your instrument.</p>

        <h6>BIANCA</h6>
        <p>Where left we last?</p>

        <h6>LUCENTIO</h6>
        <p>Here, madam:
        'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;
        Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'</p>

        <h6>BIANCA</h6>
        <p>Construe them.</p>
